# A simple use case made in a night of the previous ERC20 token implementation

i create a fictional park where everybody can enjoy riding some atractions

# Interact with the project

when you copy this ode, will allow you to generate new atractions and toincrement the supply

# Buy function

I implement a buy function that allow users buy FerParkToken, in exchange in this case of bnb

# Create an atraction function

This function allow you to generate new atractions passing a name and a a value

# retrieve ETH for FerParToken

this function allows you to exchange the remainings tokens that yuou have befre a fun day!
